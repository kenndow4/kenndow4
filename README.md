# Hi 👋, I'm Kenedy Paulino

## 🚀 About Me

I'm a **Software Developer** who started programming in **2021**. Since then, I've worked in **team-based, large-scale projects**, especially **real-time collaboration applications** where performance, scalability, and clean architecture really matter.

I enjoy building **backend systems**, **APIs**, and **full‑stack applications**, and I’m especially interested in:

* Real-time systems (WebSockets, events, collaboration tools)
* Clean architecture & scalable backends
* Modern frontend experiences with React & Next.js

I’m comfortable working in **collaborative environments**, following best practices like code reviews, Git workflows, and agile development.
